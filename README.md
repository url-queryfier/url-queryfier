# URL Queryfier
## Bulk URL Querying & Extracting in a Chrome Extension
URL Queryfier is a chrome extension that lets you run bulk URL queries/requests within the context of the current tab. This means that all cookies/login information is seamlessly integrated as part of the requests.

This extension makes it easy to test endpoints, send bulk API requests or test AJAX calls all without worrying about the specifics of CORS rules or authentication for the website you are running requests from.

## Roadmap
